This is a game made by [Danske Spil](https://danskespil.dk) together with [isobar.dk](https://isobar.dk), which I have reverse engineered from a old proxy dump.
Everything in /website is owned by Danske Spil/isobar, I have only taken this and made it playable again.

The reason I have made this game available again, is that this game shows exactly why you should never trust the client which is a really useful lesson in the hacking community.
I will be working on this project, to make some it kinda like a CTF style game, but still leaving it available to play it as a normal game (as it is quite fun).

If you or anybody have any problems with this, DO NOT hesitate to open a issue or contact me.

Enjoy!
